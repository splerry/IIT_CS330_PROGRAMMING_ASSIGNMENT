Download the attached ZIP file. Inside will be 2 programs labelled "security_engine_part1" and "security_engine_part2", the first contains the code responding to part 1 of the assignment and the second contains the code responding to part 2. To run, either open either program in an IDE or load from desktop (output should appear in command prompt window). Please run both, as either one ONLY contains the answer to its respective part.
