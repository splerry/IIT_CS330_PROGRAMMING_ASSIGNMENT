Part 1 of the assignment can be accessed using "security_engine_part1" by either running the .py file (output will appear in the command prompt window) or by opening it with an IDE. Part 2 can be accessed in the same ways. No extra steps to run are required. "security_engine.py" is the code for both in one file, however only part 2 will run without editting. Please run the designated parts instead of the mother file.
