Written in Python 3 in Windows 10.

Included are 2 executable files and 2 source code files. : 'security_engine_part1.exe', 'security_engine_part2.exe', 'security_engine_part1.py', and 'security_engine_part2.py'. The first contains the code for section 1 of the assignment, and the second contains the code for section 2. The last 2 are the source code for the 2 previous executables. 

The first executable takes user input (either one character at a time or in phrases), combines all input into one long sequence that filters out any entry besides integers 0-9, and notifies the user when either the Lock or Unlock code has been entered (see below for codes).

The second executable will run 99 simulations of a brute force method of breaking the engine from the first program; outputting the average amount of attempts per simulation, total digits entered, largest sequence with accepted code, and the smallest sequence with accepted code. View the memo for a report on the output of part 2.

to run:

1) 'git clone https://github.com/splerry/IIT_CS330_PROGRAMMING_ASSIGNMENT.git'
2) 'cd IIT_CS330_PROGRAMMING_ASSIGNMENT'
3) either './security_engine_part1.exe' Output will appear in git bash terminal. Or you may locate the foler which it is stored in and run the executable manually. If so, output will appear in the console.

Lock code: 901494
Unlock code: 901491
